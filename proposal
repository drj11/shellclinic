Shell Code Clinic

1/2 day

Come along to the shell clinic to have your shell programming
problems diagnosed, discussed, and hopefully even fixed or
remedied.  The clinic is very much a collaborative effort between
the attendees, encouraging a peer-to-peer flow of knowledge and
ideas.  David hopes that his many years of writing shell scripts
and paying too much attention to the POSIX standard during the
years when bash scripting was popular will come in useful.

Bring your code and have it improved!  Improve the code others.

Perhaps we can elevate shell from a mere scripting language to a
proper programming language?

David has helped run Python code clinics at EuroPython, and hopes
it will be as fun as those!
